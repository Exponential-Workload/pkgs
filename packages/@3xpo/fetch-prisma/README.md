# @3xpo/fetch-prisma

Tool for fetching prisma engines at runtime so you can nicely bundle everything

You should probabally be using the right tool for the job rather than prisma, but incase you're locked in and still want to provide a single-file output, enjoy!

This is done very badly, but it's better than nothing ig.
